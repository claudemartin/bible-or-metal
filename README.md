# bible-or-metal
Quiz: can you tell if the quote is from the bible or a metal song?

The URL will probably be this: https://claude-martin.ch/bible-or-metal/
"bible-or-metal" is both the name of the github repo and the angular project name.

The goal is to have a quiz like this: https://claude-martin.ch/presidential

But it's made using Angular and TypeScript. 

The quotes from metal songs will be altered slightly, so it doesn't rhyme.

Example:
```
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
```
That's from "Dawn of Battle" by Manowar.

For the quiz this is changed to:
```
I will send them all into the ground,
By the sign of the falling hammer,
Yes, Heathens will fall,
I will strike them all down,
Then you will know my calling.
```
The correct answer is "Metal" as this is from a True Metal band. 

Quotes from Black Metal could mention a "Lord", but it's not clear if it's about Yahwe or Lucifer.

There are songs in the Bible. Most quotes will be from Deuteronomy 32, but there should be enough other quotes that could just as well be from some metal song.
