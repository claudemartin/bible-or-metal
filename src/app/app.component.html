        <p>
            All you have to do is guess if the verses are quoted from a modern translation of the bible 
            (<abbr title="New International Version of the Holy Bible">NIV</abbr>) 
            or from the lyrics of some metal song (including genres, such as Heavy Metal, Hard Rock, Black Metal, et cetera).
        </p>
        <p>For most users this is just a fun quiz. For those who want to test if they truly know the word of God, 
            they can use this to see how well they know it and how easily they get tempted by the devil 
            for thinking metal quotes are His word.</p>
        <p>Not all metal lyrics featured here are satanic. There is even some White Metal mixed in and for a serious challenge 
            there are some metal lyrics based on bible verses.
            And the devil made me change some of the quotes to make it more challenging. 
            Sometimes interpunctation is added or removed, so try to ignore that.
            It could even be a small change of words to make it rhyme or not rhyme or some other alteration to make it harder.
            In that case you can see the original after you answered.
